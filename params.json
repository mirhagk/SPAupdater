{"name":"Drive-Thru SPA","tagline":"Single Page Application framework that automatically updates the application in the background","body":"### Drive-Thru SPA\r\nTake your Single Page Applications to the Drive-Thru!\r\n\r\nWeb Applications are becoming ever more common. These automatically update their own data, keeping the page fresh for the user.\r\n\r\nHowever since the data is always up-to-date, the user sees no need to reload their tab. Client side navigation means they will always stay on that same page so long as the tab is open. For some applications (Gmail, Facebook, Twitter) the tab is open so long as the computer is on, which can be many months for most users.\r\n\r\nIf a user doesn't reload the tab for 6 months, their data stays in sync with the latest, but the code does not. This means the user could be missing out on potentially 6 months of features. Worse yet, they could be missing out on 6 months of security fixes.\r\n\r\nThere are companies that have a continuous deployment process that means they can deploy to production several times a day. But what is the point if their users could still be using old code for months?\r\n\r\nDrive-Thru SPA seeks to solve this issue. It's a library designed to work with web application frameworks, watch for changes to the application, and seamlessly update the application behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nNathan Jervis - @mirhagk\r\n","google":"UA-44715403-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
